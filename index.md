# > Hi, I'm Teemu

Aspiring Cyber Specialist with a background in B2B Customer Service and Sales, transitioning into cybersecurity.
I have also graduated as a Master of Arts in English Language, so I have a strong skillset for a succesful career in cyber, whether in Finnish or English and with or without customer contact.

I am currently studying Information Technology at the Helsinki Business College, specializing in cybersecurity and a SOC Specialist role.
Thus far, my studies have included basics of networking, Windows OS and Microsoft 365 admin center and Active Directory.

I have also focused on completing modules in TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Learning Path
